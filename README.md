# Intro to geomeppy_tutorial
----

In  addition to Eppy, GeomEppy is a scripting language to Energyplus, primarily focuses on IDF geometry (zones, surfaces, constructions, etc.)
This tutorial is adapted from  GeomEppy's original documentation , which could be found here: https://geomeppy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Â¶
The intention of  this tutorial is to give a quick introduction of using GeomEppy to build geometries for idf files:
* access an idf file with geomeppy
* build a geometry for the idf file
* visualize the built geometry
* modified the built geomety: scaling, rotating, etc. 
* run energy plus on geomeppy
